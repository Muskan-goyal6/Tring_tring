# Tring_tring

Detect when the "tring tring" starts and stops. It should be very fast,
efficient and work on live streaming data.
You need to detect “tring tring” from a contiguous streaming music.
For example, whenever you dial a number, you will hear “tring tring”, and if the receiver
didn’t pick up the call, you will hear some message from the operator, for example- “the
number you had dial isn’t able to pick up the call, or the dialed number is currently busy”.
So in this case, you can say it, a continuous streaming of different types of audio, and you
need to print when that “tring tring” starts and stop during live playback.
